# Business Insights 360: Power BI Dashboard Project

## 📌 Project Overview
**Business Insights 360** is an end-to-end Power BI project developed as part of the **Codebasics Data Analytics Bootcamp**.  
It simulates real-world business scenarios for **AtliQ Hardware**, a consumer goods company specializing in computers, accessories, and hardware products sold through retailers, distributors, physical stores, and e-commerce platforms worldwide.  

The company previously relied on outdated Excel-based analysis and intuitive decision-making, leading to challenges like poor performance in regions such as **Latin America**. This project shifts AtliQ Hardware toward **data-driven insights** by creating interactive dashboards across multiple business domains: **Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive views**.  

The dashboards are built using over **1 million rows of data** covering sales, finance, targets, forecasts, products, and more, mimicking a realistic business environment.  
**Key objectives** include unlocking hidden insights, automating data processes, and enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions quickly.
