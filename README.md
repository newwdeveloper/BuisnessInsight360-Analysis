ðŸ“Š Power BI â€“ Building the Financial View (P&L)
ðŸ”§ Objective
To build a Profit & Loss (P&L) style financial matrix in Power BI, where key financial metrics like Gross Sales, Pre-Invoice Deduction, and Net Invoice Sales are arranged vertically like a financial statement â€” using a supporting table, DAX logic, and matrix visuals.

ðŸ§± Step 1: Create the Core P&L Structure
This step involves preparing the base structure that will support the dynamic P&L view.

ðŸ§¾ 1.1 Create Supporting Table for P&L Rows
Manually create a new table named P&L rows using DATATABLE to define each line item and its order:

DAX
Copy
Edit
P&L rows = DATATABLE(
    "P&L Item", STRING,
    "Order", INTEGER,
    {
        {"Gross Sales", 1},
        {"Pre-Invoice Deduction", 2},
        {"Net Invoice Sales", 3}
    }
)
This table acts as a layout blueprint for your P&L view, keeping the KPIs ordered and aligned vertically.

ðŸ§® 1.2 Create the Dynamic P&L Measure
Next, create a DAX measure named P&L values to return different financial values based on the selected row using SWITCH(TRUE()).

DAX
Copy
Edit
P&L values = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    MAX('P&L rows'[Order]) = 1, [GS â‚¹],
    MAX('P&L rows'[Order]) = 2, [Pre_Invoice_Deduction â‚¹],
    MAX('P&L rows'[Order]) = 3, [NIS â‚¹]
)
This measure dynamically pulls:

Gross Sales â†’ [GS â‚¹]

Pre-Invoice Deduction â†’ [Pre_Invoice_Deduction â‚¹]

Net Invoice Sales â†’ [NIS â‚¹]

ðŸŽ¨ 1.3 Build the Matrix Visual
Use Power BIâ€™s matrix visual to create the final view:

Rows: P&L rows[P&L Item]

Values: P&L values measure

Sort: Sort by Order column to maintain line order

Styling:

Hide column headers

Format values as currency (â‚¹)

Remove subtotals for cleaner layout
